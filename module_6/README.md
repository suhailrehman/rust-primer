# CrustyDB Walkthough 

The goal of this last module 6 of the warm up is a
[walkthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_walkthrough) CrustyDB's
codebase; you can find it [here](https://github.com/CMSC-23500-Winter2023/crustydb-23). First, this module gives you some direction on how to go about
exploring the codebase. It asks some questions (Guiding Questions, below) to
test your knowledge as you make progress. These questions are just for you, you
do not need to submit module 6 to gradescope and you do not need to run any
tests. However, we will evaluate your knowledge of CrustyDB's codebase with a
quiz that will be released on Gradescope (as usual) on this assignment's due
date. Learning how to read somebody else's codebase is important and a skill you
will (likely) need to put in practice many times in the future.

*Some Advice: Going through the following questions will take some time, but 
we promise that it is a worthwhile investment. These questions have been crafted 
to expose you to different parts of the codebase: the steps you take to get to 
the actual answer of a guiding question are as important as the answer itself. 
So, as you step through code, explore what functions are being called, what data 
types are being used, where these things are documented, etc. Even if you don't
understand every part of the code, learning how to find things in the codebase and
familiarizing yourself with its general structure is invaluable. In past years,
many students found themselves blocked waiting for a TA to answer questions on Ed
that could've been solved indepdentnly by, e.g., finding and reading a type 
definition in the codebase*

### Guiding Questions

1. Look at the module 1 README to understand crusty-cli. What is the function that actually reads user input? 

2. Place the following components in the order they occur and identify (on a very high level) the purpose of each: Parser, Executor, Optimizer

3. Crusty supports two commands right now: CREATE and something else. What is the other SQL command? 
    -   Options: Your answer should correspond to *one* of the following: value operations, set operations, query operations, select operations
    -   *Hint: To answer this question, you’ll have to start at the function you identified in Q1 and explore the different paths it can
        take.*

4. Of the above broad type (answer to Q3), what are all the operators crusty supports? This should be clear if you follow the path of functions that led you to the Q3 answer.

5. Find and look at the rust file associated with a scan (yes, we’re not telling
you where it is on purpose). Try to figure out how it interfaces with the
iterators you are going to have to write for milestone 1. 

6. Look at some other operators, like aggregate. Figure out how they get the
data they are processing.
    - What does this tell you about scan vs. other operations (aggregate, filter, join, etc.)?
    - Look at the following query plan (it is okay if you don’t totally understand it). What’s one possible order the different nodes of the graph could occur in, based on crusty?

                                 filter on predicate A
							|
							|
						      join 	
							|
							|
 		           filter on predicate Y - - - - - - filter on predicate X
				       |			            |
				       |			            |
		               scan table A	                      scan table B

7. Finally, It’s a good idea to read through all the page and heapstore function definitions, since you’ll be working with them first.
